# The following define makes your compiler warn you if you use any
# feature of Qt which has been marked as deprecated (the exact warnings
# depend on your compiler). Please consult the documentation of the
# deprecated API in order to know how to port your code away from it.
DEFINES += QT_DEPRECATED_WARNINGS

# .qml files as well as accompanying .js files can be translated into
# intermediate C++ source code.
# After compilation with a traditional compiler, the code is linked into
# the application binary. This entirely eliminates the need of deploying
# QML source code, it reduces the application startup time and allows for
# a much faster execution on platforms that do not permit Just-in-time
# compilation (See https://doc.qt.io/QtQuickCompiler/)
CONFIG += qtquickcompiler

# You can also make your code fail to compile if you use deprecated APIs.
# In order to do so, uncomment the following line.
# You can also select to disable deprecated APIs only up to a certain version
# of Qt.
DEFINES += QT_DISABLE_DEPRECATED_BEFORE=0x060000 # disables all the APIs
                                                 # deprecated before Qt 6.0.0
